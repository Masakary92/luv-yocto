    <title>Setting Up the Development Host to Use the Yocto Project</title>

    <para>
        This section provides procedures to set up your development host to
        use the Yocto Project.
        You can use the Yocto Project on a native Linux development host or
        you can use
        <ulink url='https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/crops/about/'>CROPS</ulink>,
        which leverages
        <ulink url='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker Containers</ulink>,
        to prepare any Linux, Mac, or Windows development host.
    </para>

    <para>
        Once your development host is set up to use the Yocto Project,
        further steps are necessary depending on what you want to
        accomplish.
        See the following references for information on how to prepare for
        Board Support Package (BSP) development, kernel development, and

                    You should have a reasonably current Linux-based host

                    You will have the best results with a recent release of
                    Fedora, openSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS as these
                    releases are frequently tested against the Yocto Project

                    If your build host does not meet any of these three listed

        <para>
            To use the Yocto Project, you need a release of the Yocto Project
            locally installed on your development system.
            The locally installed set of files is referred to as the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
            in the Yocto Project documentation.
        </para>

        <para>
            You create your Source Directory by using
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_GS_URL;#git'>Git</ulink> to clone a local
            copy of the upstream <filename>poky</filename> repository.
            <note><title>Tip</title>
                The preferred method of getting the Yocto Project Source
                Directory set up is to clone the repository.
            </note>
            Working from a copy of the upstream repository allows you
            to contribute back into the Yocto Project or simply work with
            the latest software on a development branch.
            Because Git maintains and creates an upstream repository with
            a complete history of changes and you are working with a local
            clone of that repository, you have access to all the Yocto
            Project development branches and tag names used in the upstream
            repository.

                    Unless you specify a specific development branch or

            When you clone the upstream poky repository, you have access to

            Each development branch in a repository is unique as it forks
            off the "master" branch.
            To see and use the files of a particular development branch
            locally, you need to know the branch name and then specifically
            check out that development branch.
            <note>
                Checking out an active development branch by branch name
                gives you a snapshot of that particular branch at the time

        <para>
            Similar to branches, the upstream repository uses tags
            to mark specific commits associated with significant points in
            a development branch (i.e. a release point or stage of a
            release).
            You might want to set up a local branch based on one of those
            points in the repository.
            The process is similar to checking out by branch name except you
            use tag names.
            <note>
                Checking out a branch based on a tag gives you a
                stable set of files not affected by development on the
                branch above the tag.

    <title>Building an Image</title>

    <para>
        In the development environment, you need to build an image whenever
        you change hardware support, add or change system libraries, or add
        or change services that have dependencies.
        Several methods exist that allow you to build an image within the
        Yocto Project.
        This section shows you how to build an image using BitBake from a
        Linux host.

    <title>Speeding Up the Build</title>

    <para>
        Build time can be an issue.
        By default, the build system uses simple controls to try and maximize
        build efficiency.
        In general, the default settings for all the following variables
        result in the most efficient build times when dealing with single
        socket systems (i.e. a single CPU).
        If you have multiple CPUs, you might try increasing the default
        values to gain more speed.
        See the descriptions in the glossary for each variable for more
        information:

        As mentioned, these variables all scale to the number of processor
        cores available on the build system.
        For single socket systems, this auto-scaling ensures that the build
        system fundamentally takes advantage of potential parallel operations
        during the build based on the build machine's capabilities.

                File system type:
                The file system type that the build is being performed on can
                also influence performance.

                Disabling the updating of access time using

                The <filename>noatime</filename> mount option prevents the

                Setting a longer commit:
                Using the "commit=" mount option increases the interval

                Changing this interval from the five second default to
                something longer increases the risk of data loss but decreases
                the need to write to the disk, thus increasing the build

                The build system goes to some lengths to avoid
                <filename>sync()</filename> calls into the
                file system on the principle that if there was a significant

                class:
                Inheriting this class has shown to speed up builds due to
                significantly lower amounts of data stored in the data
                cache as well as on disk.
                Inheriting this class also makes cleanup of

                faster, at the expense of being easily able to dive into the
                source code.
                File system maintainers have recommended that the fastest way
                to clean up large numbers of files is to reformat partitions
                rather than delete files due to the linear nature of
                partitions.
                This, of course, assumes you structure the disk partitions and
                file systems in a way that this is practical.
